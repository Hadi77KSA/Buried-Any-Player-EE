### Maxis Side
#### Wisp Step
For less than 3p, wisp will no longer rely on zombies getting near it.

#### Bells Step
On solo, bells auto-complete.  
On 2p, removed time limit. Only resets if it's failed.

### Richtofen Side
#### Round Infinity A.K.A the Time Bomb Step
On 4p or less, requires all players in the lobby to be near the location of the Time Bomb.
If the number of players is greater than 4, the step will only work if 4 players are near the location, no more no less.

#### Maze Levers
Notifies the players whether a switch flipped in a specific position has sparked or not. This is done for each switch.

### Sharpshooter
Minimum number of required targets:
- 1p: 20 targets (Candy Shop)
- 2p: 39 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon (19))
- 3p: the players can choose it to be either 61 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon + Barn (22)) or all targets. Shooting more than 65 targets on an attempt makes the step switch to check for if all targets are hit on that attempt.
- Otherwise: all 84 targets
