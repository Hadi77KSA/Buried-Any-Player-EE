### Maxis Side
#### Wisp Step
For less than 3p, wisp will no longer rely on zombies getting near it.

#### Bells Step
On solo, bells auto-complete.  
On 2p, removed time limit. Only resets if it's failed.

### Richtofen Side
#### Round Infinity A.K.A the Time Bomb Step
Can be done with less than 4 players. Requires all players in the lobby to be near the location of the Time Bomb.

### Sharpshooter
Minimum number of required targets:
- 1p: 20 targets (Candy Shop)
- 2p: 39 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon (19))
- 3p: the players can choose it to be either 61 targets (Candy Shop + Saloon + Barn (22)) or all targets. Shooting more than 65 targets on an attempt makes the step switch to check for if all targets are hit on that attempt.
- Otherwise: all 84 targets
